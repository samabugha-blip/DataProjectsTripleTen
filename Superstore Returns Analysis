# Tableau Project – RETURNS ANALYSIS STORYTELLING DASHBOARD

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an interactive Tableau dashboard that analyzes product returns to identify patterns across **categories, states/regions, and time**. The goal is to help stakeholders understand **where and why returns are happening**, so they can reduce return rates and improve customer satisfaction.

The dashboard lets users:
- Compare return rates by **product category**
- Explore returns by **state/region**
- Track **return trends over time**
- Drill down into specific segments using filters

> Replace this line with 1–2 sentences about YOUR specific project focus, e.g. app ratings, sales, marketing funnel, etc.

## 🗂️ Dataset

**Source:** TripleTen

**Main tables used:**
- `orders` – order ID, order date, ship date, customer, state, category, sales, profit, etc.
- `returns` – return ID, order ID, return reason, return status

> Update these table names/fields to match your actual dataset.

Key transformations performed:
- Joined **returns** to **orders** on `order_id`
- Calculated **return rate** by using:
  - `return_rate = number_of_returned_orders / total_orders`
- Created date fields for analysis by **month** and **year**

## 🎯 Business Questions

This project was designed to answer questions like:

1. Which **product categories** have the highest return rates?
2. Which **states/regions** experience the most returns?
3. How have **return rates changed over time**?
4. Are there specific combinations (e.g., **state + category**) that are driving returns?
5. What **insights or recommendations** can be given to reduce returns?

> Change or add questions so they match your real project.
