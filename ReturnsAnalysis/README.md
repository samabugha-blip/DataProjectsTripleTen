## 2. Project Description

This project is an interactive Tableau dashboard designed to explore and analyze product returns using order and return data.  
The goal is to uncover *why* returns happen, *what groups drive the most returns*, and *what patterns emerge over time*.  
This helps businesses improve product quality, customer experience, and operational efficiency.

### 🔍 **What this project solves**
Product returns are costly and disrupt operations. This analysis helps answer:
- Which categories have the highest return rate?
- How do return trends change over time?
- Which products or categories require improvement?
- Are there patterns indicating seasonality or quality issues?

### 🛠 Tools Used
- **Tableau** for visualization
- **SQL** for data preparation and joins
- **Google Sheets / CSV** for raw data
- **GitHub** for version control and documentation

### 📈 Key Insights Uncovered
(Replace these with your final insights)
- Certain categories show a much higher return rate compared to others.
- Monthly return trends reveal clear seasonal spikes.
- Some categories have low return counts but *high return rates*, indicating potential quality issues.
- Return behavior varies significantly when combining *category + month*.
