# NYC AirBNB Data

This spreadsheet project explores patterns in New York City's AirBnB market.

### Objective

The goal of the project was to clean the data and prepare a report providing an understanding of what drives listing popularity and revenue across neighborhoods, property types, and room sizes.

Number of reviews is the criteria for an attractive listing.

#### The Process

I first explored the dataset to find and fix missing and duplicate values, and I merged DataFrames from different sources. Finally, I analyzed the data using visualizations and pivot tables.

### Results

- The Lower East Side is the most popular neighborhood according to listing counts, reviews, and guest activity.
- Across NYC, 1 bedroom listings were the most common and in demand bedroom size, indicating a strong preference for smaller, more affordable units among travelers.
- The top performing listing generated roughly $3,000.
