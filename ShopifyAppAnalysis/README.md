# 📊 Shopify App Success Analysis — Power BI Project

## 1. Project Name
**Shopify App Success Analysis: Identifying Key Factors Behind High-Performing Apps**

---

## 2. Project Description

I was hired to analyze the landscape of apps available on the Shopify App Store, using data scraped from publicly available sources.  
The main objective of this project is to identify the **key factors that drive the success of a Shopify app**, such as:

- App category  
- Review volume  
- Rating distribution  
- Pricing models  
- Developer responsiveness  
- Category placement  

This Power BI report brings together all components of the dataset into an interactive dashboard that reveals insights about what separates top-performing apps from the rest.  

### 🔍 Key Questions This Project Answers
- What categories contain the most successful apps?
- Do higher review counts correlate with higher app ratings?
- How does the number of reviews impact app ranking and visibility?
- Are developer responses associated with better user sentiment?
- What patterns differentiate top 10% apps from the rest?

### 🧠 Tools Used
- **Power BI Desktop** for data modeling, DAX, and dashboard creation  
- **Excel (shopify.xlsx)** for source data  
- **Power Query** for cleaning and shaping data  
- **GitHub** for project hosting and documentation
